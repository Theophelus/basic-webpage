              <p><span>INDIA:</span></br>
              The real reason I love India is The Taj Mahal. Is one of the
              most beautiful places in the world. is the most iconic symbol of India and is, arguably,
               the most famous monument in the world. Built by the Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his favourite wife,
               this is widely considered one of the most beautiful architectural wonders ever created.
              A visit to this marble mausoleum needs to be on every traveller’s list.</p>
